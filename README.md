# NEPSE Historical Data Scraper

A Python project to scrape historical stock market data from the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) using the [nepse_scraper](https://github.com/polymorphisma/nepse_scraper/) package.

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Local Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install nepse-scraper pandas
```

### Option 2: Docker Installation

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   ./docker-run.sh build
   
   # Windows
   docker-run.bat build
   
   # Or manually
   docker build -t nepse-scraper:latest .
   ```

2. **Quick start with Docker:**
   ```bash
   # Get latest data once
   ./docker-run.sh latest
   
   # Run continuously every 60 minutes
   ./docker-run.sh continuous
   
   # Interactive mode
   ./docker-run.sh interactive
   ```

## üîß Usage

### üê≥ Docker Usage (Recommended)

Docker provides consistent, isolated environments and easier deployment:

#### Quick Docker Commands
```bash
# Build the image
./docker-run.sh build

# Get latest market data (one-time)
./docker-run.sh latest

# Run continuous scraping every 30 minutes
./docker-run.sh continuous 30

# Scrape specific securities
./docker-run.sh specific "NABIL,NICA,SCBL,EBL"

# Interactive mode
./docker-run.sh interactive

# View logs of running container
./docker-run.sh logs

# Stop all containers
./docker-run.sh stop
```

#### Docker Compose
```bash
# Start continuous scraper service
docker-compose up -d nepse-scraper

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f nepse-scraper

# Stop service
docker-compose down
```

üìñ **For detailed Docker usage, see [DOCKER_README.md](DOCKER_README.md)**

### üíª Local Usage

#### Option 1: Full Historical Scraper

Run the comprehensive scraper:

```bash
python nepse_historical_scraper.py
```

This script offers three options:

1. **Scrape ALL securities** (Warning: Takes several hours!)
2. **Scrape specific securities** (Enter comma-separated symbols)
3. **Test with sample securities** (NABIL, NICA, SCBL, SANIMA, EBL)

#### Option 2: Simple Scraper

Run the simple scraper for quick data:

```bash
python simple_nepse_scraper.py
```

This script offers:

1. Get latest trading data for all securities
2. Get data for specific securities (with recent history)
3. Get market summary
4. Exit

## Data Format

The scraped data includes the following fields:

- `symbol` - Security symbol (e.g., NABIL, NICA)
- `openPrice` - Opening price
- `highPrice` - Highest price of the day
- `lowPrice` - Lowest price of the day
- `lastTradedPrice` - Last traded price
- `totalTradedQuantity` - Total quantity traded
- `totalTradedValue` - Total value traded
- `date` - Trading date
- Additional market data fields

## Important Notes

### NEPSE API Limitations

- **Date Range**: NEPSE only provides data from today to one year prior
- **Trading Days Only**: Data is only available for trading days (weekdays when market is open)
- **Rate Limiting**: The script includes delays between requests to avoid overloading the API

### Data Accuracy

- Data comes directly from NEPSE's official API
- Historical data may have gaps for non-trading days
- Always verify important data with official NEPSE sources

### Performance Considerations

- Scraping all securities can take several hours
- Use the simple scraper for quick data needs
- Consider scraping specific securities rather than all at once

## Example Usage

### Scrape Specific Securities

```python
from nepse_scraper import Nepse_scraper
import pandas as pd

# Initialize scraper
scraper = Nepse_scraper()

# Get today's data
data = scraper.get_today_price()

# Get specific date data
data = scraper.get_today_price('2024-08-01')

# Get all securities list
securities = scraper.get_all_security()
```

### Sample Output Files

```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NABIL_historical_data.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NICA_historical_data.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SCBL_historical_data.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ market_summary_20250810_143022.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nepse_latest_data_20250810_143022.csv
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Error**: Make sure `nepse-scraper` is installed

   ```bash
   pip install nepse-scraper
   ```

2. **No Data Found**: Check if the market is open or if the date is a trading day

3. **API Errors**: The script includes retry logic, but if you get persistent errors:

   - Check your internet connection
   - Try again later (API might be temporarily unavailable)
   - Reduce the frequency of requests by increasing delay

4. **Date Format Errors**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates

### Logging

- Check `nepse_scraper.log` for detailed error logs
- The script provides console output for progress tracking

## Dependencies

- **nepse-scraper**: The main package for NEPSE API access
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and CSV output
- **requests**: HTTP requests (dependency of nepse-scraper)
- **retrying**: Retry logic for failed requests

## Legal and Ethical Usage

- This script uses the official NEPSE API through the nepse_scraper package
- Respect the API rate limits and don't overload the servers
- Use the data responsibly and in accordance with NEPSE's terms of service
- The data is for informational purposes only

## Contributing

Feel free to improve this script by:

- Adding more data validation
- Implementing additional data formats (JSON, Excel)
- Adding more sophisticated error handling
- Optimizing performance
